              <h2>The <tt>@LDAPDNField</tt> and <tt>@LDAPEntryField</tt> Annotation Types</h2>

              <p>
                The <tt>@LDAPDNField</tt> annotation type may be used to mark at most one field in
                a Java class, and when initializing and instance of that class with information
                from an LDAP entry, the DN of that entry will be stored in that field.  If a field
                is marked with this annotation type, then it must have a type of
                <tt>java.lang.String</tt>.
              </p>

              <p>
                The <tt>@LDAPEntryField</tt> annotation type may be used to mark at most one field
                in a Java class, and when initializing an instance of that class with information
                from an LDAP entry, a read-only copy of that entry will be stored in that field.
                If a field is marked with this annotation type, then it must have a type of
                <tt>com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.ReadOnlyEntry</tt>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Zero, one, or both of these annotation types may be used in any class marked with
                the <tt>@LDAPObject</tt> annotation type (although if a class contains a field
                marked with the <tt>@LDAPEntryField</tt> annotation type then the DN of the entry
                can be gotten from that, so there really isn't a need to also have a field marked
                with the <tt>@LDAPDNField</tt> annotation type).  Neither field may be marked
                <tt>static</tt> or <tt>final</tt>, although they may have any access modifier,
                including <tt>public</tt>, <tt>private</tt>, <tt>protected</tt>, or the default of
                package-level access.
              </p>

              <p>
                When attempting to modify or delete an entry retrieved using the LDAP SDK
                persistence framework, either of these fields may be used to obtain the DN of the
                target entry.  In addition, when performing a modify operation, if the class
                contains a field marked with the <tt>@LDAPEntryField</tt> annotation type then that
                entry may be used to better identify the changes made to the object so that it can
                construct a more concise set of modifications.
              </p>
