              <h2>The <tt>@LDAPObject</tt> Annotation Type</h2>

              <p>
                The classes for objects that should be used in conjunction with the UnboundID LDAP
                SDK persistence framework should be marked with an <tt>@LDAPObject</tt> annotation
                which provides information about how objects of that type should be stored in the
                directory server.  Java classes marked with this annotation type must public, must
                be non-abstract and must have a zero-argument constructor.
              </p>

              <p>
                Elements that may be present in the <tt>@LDAPObject</tt> annotation type include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <tt>structuralClass</tt> -- This element is used to specify the name (or OID)
                  of the structural object class that should be used for entries created from
                  objects that are instances of the marked Java class.  If this is not provided,
                  then it will be assumed that the structural object class has the same name as the
                  Java class.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>auxiliaryClass</tt> -- This element is used to specify the names (or OIDs) of
                  any auxiliary object classes that should be used for entries created from objects
                  that are instances of the marked Java class.  If this is not provided, then it
                  will be assumed that no auxiliary object classes will be used.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>postEncodeMethod</tt> -- This element is used to specify the name of a Java
                  method contained in the marked class which should be invoked after all other
                  encoding (based on annotated fields and methods in the class) has been performed
                  to construct an LDAP entry that represents the contents of the Java class.  This
                  method must take exactly one argument of type
                  <tt>com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.Entry</tt>.  It may alter the contents of the entry in
                  any way, and it may throw any kind of exception to indicate that the entry is not
                  acceptable.  If this is not provided, then no post-encode method will be invoked.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>postDecodeMethod</tt> -- This element is used to specify the name of a Java
                  method contained in the marked class which should be invoked after all other
                  decoding (based on annotated fields and methods in the class) has been performed
                  to initialize an instance of the class from an LDAP entry.  This method must not
                  take any arguments.  It may throw any kind of exception if the decoded object is
                  not valid.  If this is not provided, then no post-decode method will be invoked.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>defaultParentDN</tt> -- This element is used to specify the default parent DN
                  for entries created from objects of the associated type if no explicit parent DN
                  is given.  If this is not provided, then there will not be a default parent DN
                  and an explicit parent DN should always be provided when it is needed.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
