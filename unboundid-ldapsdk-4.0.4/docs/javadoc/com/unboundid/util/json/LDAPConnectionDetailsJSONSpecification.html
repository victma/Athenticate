<div class="block">This class provides a utility that may be used to obtain information that may
 be used to create LDAP connections to one or more servers from a definition
 contained in a JSON object.  This makes it easier to create applications that
 provide the information necessary for creating LDAP connections and
 connection pools in a JSON-formatted configuration file.
 <BR><BR>
 The JSON-based specification is organized into five sections:
 <OL>
   <LI>
     A "server-details" section that provides information about the directory
     server(s) to access.  The specification supports accessing a single
     server, as well as a number of schemes for establishing connections
     across multiple servers.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     A "communication-security" section that provides information that may be
     used to secure communication using SSL or StartTLS.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     A "connection-options" section that can be used customize a number of
     connection-related options, like connect and response timeouts, whether
     to follow referrals, whether to retrieve schema from the backend server
     for client-side use, and whether to use synchronous mode for more
     efficient communication if connections will not be used in an
     asynchronous manner.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     An "authentication-details" section that provides information for
     authenticating connections using a number of mechanisms.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     A "connection-pool-options" section that provides information to use to
     customize the behavior to use for connection pools created from this
     specification.
   </LI>
 </OL>
 Each of these sections will be described in more detail below.
 <BR><BR>
 <H2>The "server-details" Section</H2>
 The JSON object that comprises the LDAP connection details specification must
 have a top-level "server-details" field whose value is a JSON object that
 provides information about the server(s) to which connections may be
 established.  The value of the "server-details" field must itself be a JSON
 object, and that object must have exactly one field, which depends on the
 mechanism that the LDAP SDK should use to select the target directory
 servers.
 <BR><BR>
 <B>The "server-details" Section for Connecting to a Single Server</B>
 <BR>
 When establishing a connection to a single server, the "server-details"
 value should be a JSON object that contains a "single-server" field whose
 value is a JSON object with "address" and "port" fields.  For example, the
 following is a valid specification that may be used to establish connections
 to the server at ldap.example.com on port 389:
 <PRE>
   {
     "server-details":
     {
       "single-server":
       {
         "address":"ldap.example.com",
         "port":389
       }
     }
   }
 </PRE>
 <BR>
 <B>The "server-details" Section for Selecting from a Set of Servers in a
 Round-Robin Manner</B>
 <BR>
 If you have a set of servers that you want to connect to in a round-robin
 manner (in which the LDAP SDK will maintain a circular list of servers and
 each new connection will go to the next server in the list), the
 "server-details" value should be a JSON object that contains a
 "round-robin-set" field whose value is a JSON object that contains a "server"
 field with an array of JSON objects, each of which contains "address" and
 "port" fields for a target server.  For example, the following is a valid
 specification that may be used to establish connections across the servers
 ldap1.example.com, ldap2.example.com, and ldap3.example.com, all on port 389:
 <PRE>
   {
     "server-details":
     {
       "round-robin-set":
       {
         "servers":
         [
           {
             "address":"ldap1.example.com",
             "port":389
           },
           {
             "address":"ldap2.example.com",
             "port":389
           },
           {
             "address":"ldap2.example.com",
             "port":389
           }
         ]
       }
     }
   }
 </PRE>
 <BR>
 <B>The "server-details" Section for Selecting from a Set of Servers in a
 Fewest Connections Manner</B>
 <BR>
 If you have a set of servers that you want to connect to in a manner that
 selects the server with the fewest established connections (at least
 connections created from this specification), the "server-details" value
 should be a JSON object that contains a "fewest-connections-set" field whose
 value is a JSON object that contains a "server" field with an array of JSON
 objects, each of which contains "address" and "port" fields for a target
 server.  For example, the following is a valid specification that may be used
 to establish connections across the servers ldap1.example.com,
 ldap2.example.com, and ldap3.example.com, all on port 389:
 <PRE>
   {
     "server-details":
     {
       "fewest-connections-set":
       {
         "servers":
         [
           {
             "address":"ldap1.example.com",
             "port":389
           },
           {
             "address":"ldap2.example.com",
             "port":389
           },
           {
             "address":"ldap2.example.com",
             "port":389
           }
         ]
       }
     }
   }
 </PRE>
 <BR>
 <B>The "server-details" Section for Selecting from a Set of Servers in a
 Fastest Connect Manner</B>
 <BR>
 If you have a set of servers that you want to connect to in a manner that
 attempts to minimize the time required to establish new connections (by
 simultaneously attempting to create connections to every server in the set
 and taking the first connection to be established), the "server-details"
 value should be a JSON object that contains a "fastest-connect-set" field
 whose value is a JSON object that contains a "server" field with an array of
 JSON objects, each of which contains "address" and "port" fields for a target
 server.  For example, the following is a valid specification that may be used
 to establish connections across the servers ldap1.example.com,
 ldap2.example.com, and ldap3.example.com, all on port 389:
 <PRE>
   {
     "server-details":
     {
       "fastest-connect-set":
       {
         "servers":
         [
           {
             "address":"ldap1.example.com",
             "port":389
           },
           {
             "address":"ldap2.example.com",
             "port":389
           },
           {
             "address":"ldap2.example.com",
             "port":389
           }
         ]
       }
     }
   }
 </PRE>
 <BR>
 <B>The "server-details" Section for Selecting from a Set of Servers in a
 Failover Manner</B>
 <BR>
 If you have a set of servers that you want to connect to in a manner that
 attempts to consistently establish connections to the same server (as long as
 it is available, and use a consistent failover order if the preferred server
 isn't available), the "server-details" value should be a JSON object that
 contains a "failover-set" field whose value is a JSON object that contains a
 "failover-order" field that provides a list of the details to use in order
 to establish the connections.  For example, the following is a valid
 specification that may be used to always try to establish connections to
 ldap1.example.com:389, then try ldap2.example.com:389, and then try
 ldap3.example.com:389:
 <PRE>
   {
     "server-details":
     {
       "failover-set":
       {
         "failover-order":
         [
           {
             "single-server":
             {
               "address":"ldap1.example.com",
               "port":389
             }
           },
           {
             "single-server":
             {
               "address":"ldap2.example.com",
               "port":389
             }
           },
           {
             "single-server":
             {
               "address":"ldap2.example.com",
               "port":389
             }
           }
         ]
       }
     }
   }
 </PRE>
 The failover set actually has the ability to perform failover across any kind
 of set.  This is a powerful capability that can be useful to define a
 hierarchy of sets, for example for sets referring to servers in different
 data centers (e.g., to prefer connecting to one of the servers in the local
 data center over servers in a remote data center).  For example, the
 following is a valid specification that may be used to connect to the server
 with the fewest connections in the east data center, but if no east servers
 are available then it will fail over to select the server with the fewest
 connections in the west data center:
 <PRE>
   {
     "server-details":
     {
       "failover-set":
       {
         "failover-order":
         [
           {
             "fewest-connections-set":
             {
               "servers":
               [
                 {
                   "address":"ldap1.east.example.com",
                   "port":389
                 },
                 {
                   "address":"ldap2.east.example.com",
                   "port":389
                 }
               ]
             }
           },
           {
             "fewest-connections-set":
             {
               "servers":
               [
                 {
                   "address":"ldap1.west.example.com",
                   "port":389
                 },
                 {
                   "address":"ldap2.west.example.com",
                   "port":389
                 }
               ]
             }
           }
         ]
       }
     }
   }
 </PRE>
 For connections that are part of a connection pool, failover sets have the
 ability to assign a different maximum connection age to connections created
 to a non-preferred server.  This can help allow failover connections to be
 migrated back to the preferred server more quickly once that server is
 available again.  If you wish to specify an alternate maximum connection age
 for connections to a non-preferred server, you may include the
 "maximum-failover-connection-age-millis" field in the "failover-set" object.
 The value of this field should be a number that is greater than zero to
 specify the maximum age (in milliseconds) for those connections, or a value
 of zero to indicate that they should not be subject to a maximum age.  If
 this field is not present, then these connections will be assigned the
 default maximum connection age configured for the pool.
 <BR><BR>
 <H2>The "communication-security" Section</H2>
 This section may be used to provide information about the type of security to
 use to protect communication with directory servers.  If the specification
 includes information about multiple servers, then all servers will use the
 same type of security.
 <BR><BR>
 If present, the "communication-security" field should have a value that is a
 JSON object.  This object must have a "security-type" field with one of the
 following values:
 <UL>
   <LI>
     "none" -- Indicates that no communication security should be used.  The
     communication will not be encrypted.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "SSL" -- Indicates that all communication should be encrypted with the
     SSL (secure sockets layer) protocol, or more likely its more secure
     successor TLS (transport-layer security) protocol.  You can also specify
     a value of "TLS" to use this type of security.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "StartTLS" -- Indicates that the connection will be initially established
     in a non-secure manner, but will be immediately secured with the StartTLS
     extended operation.
   </LI>
 </UL>
 If you do not wish to use any form of communication security, then the
 "security-type" field is the only one that should be present.  For example,
 the following is a valid specification that will use unencrypted
 communication to the server ldap.example.com on port 389:
 <PRE>
   {
     "server-details":
     {
       "single-server":
       {
         "address":"ldap.example.com",
         "port":389
       }
     },
     "communication-security":
     {
       "security-type":"none"
     }
   }
 </PRE>
 <BR>
 If you wish to secure the communication with either SSL or StartTLS, then
 there are a number of other options that may be specified using fields in the
 "communication-security" object.  Those options fall into two basic
 categories:  fields that provide information about how the client should
 determine whether to trust the certificate presented by the server, and
 fields that provide information about whether the client should present its
 own certificate to the server.  The fields related to client trust include:
 <UL>
   <LI>
     "trust-all-certificates" -- Indicates whether the client should blindly
     trust any certificate that the server presents to it.  Using blind trust
     is convenient for testing and troubleshooting purposes, but is not
     recommended for production use because it can leave the communication
     susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.  If this field is present, then
     it should have a boolean value.  If it is not present, a default value
     of <code>false</code> will be assumed.  If it is present with a value of
     <code>true</code>, then the "trust-store-file", "trust-store-type",
     "trust-store-pin", and "trust-store-pin-file" fields should not be used.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "trust-store-file" -- Specifies the path to a trust store file (in JKS
     or PKCS#12 format).  If this is present, then the presented certificate
     will only be trusted if the trust store file contains information about
     all of the issuers in the certificate chain.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "trust-store-type"  -- Indicates the format for the trust store file.
     If this is present, then its value should be a string that is either
     "JKS" or "PKCS12".  If it is not present, then a default trust store type
     of "JKS" will be assumed.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "trust-store-pin" -- Specifies the PIN that should be used to access the
     contents of the trust store.  If this field is present, then its value
     should be a string that is the clear-text PIN.  If it is not present,
     then the PIN may be read from a file specified using the
     "trust-store-pin-file" field.  If neither the "trust-store-pin" field nor
     the "trust-store-pin-file" field is present, then no PIN will be used
     when attempting to access the trust store (and in many cases, no trust
     store PIN will be required).
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "trust-store-pin-file" -- Specifies the path to a file that contains the
     PIN to use to access the contents of the trust store.  If this field is
     present, then its value must be the path to a file containing a single
     line, which is the clear-text PIN.  If it is not present, then the PIN
     may be obtained from the "trust-store-pin" field.  If neither the
     "trust-store-pin" field nor the "trust-store-pin-file" field is present,
     then no PIN will be used when attempting to access the trust store (and
     in many cases, no trust store PIN will be required).
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "trust-expired-certificates" -- Indicates whether the client should
     trust certificates that are not yet valid or that have expired.  If this
     field is present, then its value must be a boolean.  If the value is
     <code>true</code>, then the certificate validity dates will not be taken into
     consideration when deciding whether to trust a certificate.  If the value
     is <code>false</code>, then any certificate whose validity window does not
     include the current time will not be trusted (even if
     "trust-all-certificates" is <code>true</code>).  If this field is not present,
     then a default of <code>false</code> will be assumed.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "verify-address-in-certificate" -- Indicates whether the client should
     examine the information contained in the certificate to verify that the
     address the client used to connect to the server matches address
     information contained in the certificate (whether in the CN attribute of
     the certificate's subject, or in a subjectAltName extension of type
     dNSName, uniformResourceIdentifier, or iPAddress).  If this field is
     present, then its value must be a boolean.  If it is absent, then a
     default value of <code>false</code> will be assumed.
   </LI>
 </UL>
 If none of the above fields are provided, then the JVM's default trust
 mechanism will be used.  This will generally only trust certificates signed
 by a well-known certification authority.
 <BR><BR>
 The fields related to presenting a client certificate include:
 <UL>
   <LI>
     "key-store-file" -- Specifies the path to a key store file (in JKS or
     PKCS#12 format) that contains the certificate that the client should
     present to the server.  If this is present, then the value must be a
     string that is the path to the key store file.  If it is not present,
     then no key store file will be used.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "key-store-type" -- Specifies the type of key store that should be used.
     If this is present, then its value must be a string, and that string
     should be "JKS" or "PKCS12" (if a "key-store-file" value is present), or
     "PKCS11" (if the client certificate is contained in a security module
     accessible via the PKCS#11 API.  If this field is not present but a
     "key-store-file" value is provided, then a default value of "JKS" will be
     assumed.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "key-store-pin" -- Specifies the PIN that should be used to access the
     contents of the key store.  If this field is present, then its value
     should be a string that is the clear-text PIN.  If it is not present,
     then the PIN may be read from a file specified using the
     "key-store-pin-file" field.  If neither the "key-store-pin" field nor the
     "key-store-pin-file" field is present, then no PIN will be used when
     attempting to access the key store (although key stores generally require
     a PIN in order to access private key information).
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "key-store-pin-file" -- Specifies the path to a file containing the PIN
     that should be used to access the contents of the key store.  If this

     it is not present, then a default of <code>false</code> will be assumed.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "invoke-authentication-health-checks" -- Indicates whether the connection
     pool should invoke health check processing on connections just after they
     have been authenticated.  This includes after a successful bind on a
     newly-created connection, and after calls to the connection pool's
     <code>bindAndRevertAuthentication</code> and
     <code>releaseAndReAuthenticateConnection</code> methods.  If this field is
     present, then its value must be a boolean.  If it is not present, then a
     default of <code>false</code> will be assumed.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "invoke-exception-health-checks" -- Indicates whether the connection pool
     should invoke health check processing on connections just after an
     exception is caught that might indicate that the connection is no longer
     valid.  Note that this only applies to exceptions caught during
     operations processed directly against the connection pool and not to
     exceptions caught on a connection checked out of the pool.  If this field
     is present, then its value must be a boolean.  If it is not present, then
     a default of <code>true</code> will be assumed.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "invoke-release-health-checks" -- Indicates whether the connection pool
     should invoke health check processing on connections just before they are
     released back to the pool to ensure that they are valid.  If this field
     is present, then its value must be a boolean.  If it is not present, then
     a default of <code>false</code> will be assumed.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "maximum-connection-age-millis" -- Specifies the maximum length of time
     (in milliseconds) that a connection should be allowed to remain
     established before it is eligible to be closed and replaced with a
     newly-created connection.  If present, then the value must be a positive
     integer to specify the maximum age, or zero to indicate that no maximum
     age should be applied.  If it is not present, then a default value of
     zero will be used.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "maximum-defunct-replacement-connection-age-millis" -- Specifies the
     maximum connection age (in milliseconds) that should be used for
     connections created to replace a defunct connection.  If present, then
     the value must be a positive integer to specify the maximum age, or zero
     to indicate that no maximum age should be applied.  If it is not present,
     then the value of the "maximum-connection-age-millis" field will be used
     for connections created as replacements for defunct connections.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "maximum-wait-time-millis" -- Specifies the maximum length of time (in
     milliseconds) that the pool should wait for a connection to be released
     if one is needed but none are immediately available.  If present, then
     this value must be a positive integer to specify the length of time to
     wait, or zero to indicate that it should not wait at all.  If it is not
     provided, then a default value of zero will be used.
   </LI>
   <LI>
     "retry-failed-operations-due-to-invalid-connections" -- Indicates whether
     the pool should automatically attempt to retry operations attempted
     directly against the pool (but not for connections checked out of the
     pool) if the initial attempt fails in a manner that may indicate that the
     connection is no longer valid.  If this field is present, then its value
     may be either a boolean to indicate whether to enable retry for all types
     of operations or no operations, or it may be an array of strings
     indicating the operation types ("add", "bind", "compare", "delete",
     "extended", "modify", "modify-dn", or "search") that should be retried
     in the event of a failure.  If this field is not present, then no
     automatic retry will be attempted.
   </LI>
 </UL>
 <BR>
 The "connection-pool-options" field is optional, and if it is omitted from
 the specification then the default values will be used for all options.</div>
