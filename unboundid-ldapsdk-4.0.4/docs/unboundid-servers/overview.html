              <h2>Overview of Additional UnboundID-Specific Functionality</h2>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides a significant amount of additional
                functionality that is available for use when the SDK is used to communicate with
                an instance of the Ping Identity, UnboundID, or Alcatel-Lucent 8661 Directory
                Server.  This page describes that additional functionality.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Additional Controls</h3>

              <p>
                The following additional controls are available when communicating with a
                Ping Identity, UnboundID, or Alcatel-Lucent 8661 Directory Server instance:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Account Usability Control</b> -- Provides information about whether a
                  specified user account is available for use, and if not information about why it
                  may be unavailable.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Administrative Operation Control</b> -- Indicates that the associated request
                  is intended for some administrative purpose rather than a general application
                  request.  Operations with this control may be treated specially by the server,
                  including placing additional information in access log messages and excluding
                  them from inclusion in response time histogram tracking.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Batched Transaction Specification Control</b> -- Indicates that the associated
                  operation is part of a batched transaction.  This must be used in conjunction
                  with the start batched transaction and end batched transaction extended
                  operations.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                  a specified set of branches from search results.
                  <br><br>

                  considered read-only) as part of the server schema.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Get Server ID Control</b> -- Provides a way for the client to request
                  information about which server was actually used to process a request (including
                  the ability to make that determination through a Directory Proxy Server).  It
                  may be used in conjunction with the route to server request control to request
                  that an operation be processed by a specific server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>

                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Interactive Transaction Specification Control</b> -- Indicates that the
                  specified operation is part of an interactive transaction.  This must be used in

                  transaction extended operations.
                  <br><br>

                <li>
                  <b>Intermediate Client Control</b> -- May be used to help track requests and
                  responses through a directory environment (e.g., between a client, a directory
                  proxy server, and a directory server).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>

                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>

                  identify itself to the server and provide information about the reason for the
                  associated operation.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Real Attributes Only Control</b> -- Indicates that search entries returned
                  should not include any virtual attributes.

                  routed to a particular backend server.  This is primarily intended for use when

                  <b>Unsolicited Cancel Control</b> -- Indicates that the associated operation was
                  canceled by the Directory Server for a reason other than being canceled by the
                  client (e.g., because the client connection is being closed or the server is
                  shutting down and all outstanding requests are being canceled).
                  <br><br>
