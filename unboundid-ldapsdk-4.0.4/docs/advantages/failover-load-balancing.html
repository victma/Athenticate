              <h2>Support for Failover and Load Balancing</h2>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides a mechanism that can be used to manage
                 connections across multiple servers.  This can be used to provide basic support
                 for failover and load balancing, and it can be used for single connections as well
                 as connection pools (so a single connection pool may contain connections to
                 multiple servers, effectively balancing the load across those servers).
              </p>

              <p>
                The abstract <tt>ServerSet</tt> class defines the basic API used to provide this
                functionality.  At present, the following implementations are available:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A single server set, which contains a reference to a single server.  It is
                  primarily used for cases in which a server set may be needed, but only a single
                  server is to be used.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  A round robin server set, in which each subsequent connection will be established
                  to the next server in the specified list.  If a given server isn't available,
                  then it will be skipped and the server set will move to the next server in the
                  list.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  A failover server set, in which all attempts to create a connection will be tried
                  against the first server in the list, and will only try the second if the first
                  is unavailable, and only try the third if both the first and second are
                  unavailable, etc.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Additional implementations are planned for the future, and developers can create
                their own custom implementations as well.
              </p>

              <p>
                Note that the failover server set can also provide failover across server sets, so
                it is possible to define more complex configurations (e.g., if possible, use
                round-robin load balancing across servers in the local data center, but if none of
                them are available then fail over to a round-robin set of servers in a remote data
                center).
              </p>
